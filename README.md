### What is Candidate Tweet Analysis?
 
Tracks all of Twitter's tweets and shows metrics for each candidate:
* Number of tweets
* Sentiments analysis (positive / negative)
* Popular hash tags

### Why I built it:

The primary reason for building was to learn / improve my abilities with the following technologies
* Node.js -- This is my first deployed project using node.js
* React.js -- This is my second deployed project using React.js
* Web Sockets -- This is my first deployed project using web sockets
* Jade -- Used to protoype this idea (before reactifying), my first use of Jade
* Gulp -- First use of a gulpfile
* Flexbox -- First intentional use of flexbox throughout a project

###Technologies Used:

Node.js | React.js | Web Sockets | Jade | Gulp | ChartJS | Sentiment | JSX | Flexbox

### Feature roadmap: 

* This was created as a learning tool, March, 2016
* There are no immediate plans to add functionality or continue to maintain the code base
